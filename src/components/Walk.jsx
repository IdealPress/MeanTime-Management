            Meantime Management, in partnership with the Union of temporal workers, have created an audio-guide for reconstructing the Merdian Line & deconstructing Meridian Time (GMT).
          </p>
          <p>
          Join us as we ramble our way across the peninsula, discussing the landmarks which have come to order our sense of time and timeliness – and imagine other modes of temporal discipline & reorganisation from the past, through the present, into the future.

          <p>The observatory serves as a sanctuary for our tidy linear time. The architecture makes way for the sharp laser that defines the meridian. In its romantic natural surroundings the air density is light, there is space to breathe. It is a calming place, where one finds space and time to think, reflect, or just stroll around.</p>
          <p>When we cross the river we arrive in the area where the time that is preached at the sanctuary, is actually experienced: Canary Wharf. The more we move to this work-oriented sphere, the denser the air becomes. Breathing becomes a sport. We enter a less tidy architecture. Chasing linear time results in architectural eclecticism. But this is okay, because there is nobody that has brain space to notice this. It is striking how disconnected people in this area are from the calming atmosphere where time originates.</p>
          <p>What divides the Observatory sanctuary from Canary Wharf is the almighty river Thames. Linear and snaking at the same time, it proclaims untidiness. Its banks provide space for improvisation and acknowledge the backside of things. Instead of ostensibly proclaiming tidiness or living untidiness, it lives time in its own way. I’d call it tide-iness.</p>

          <p>I love this tour! It is so inspiring. I visited Greenwich royal observatory before but I just had a look of that line and left. I didn’t know those stories behind! The labour and dock part and the privatisation of time is also interesting. Besides I really like the poem you read besides the river Thames. Other than the talks, I think walking in that tunnel is a weird but interesting experience. It is in a white, uniform, tube-like shape that goes on and on. I can’t see the end of it. There is no reference objects or subjects for the passing time, such as the moving sun and the running water. It kinda changed my perception of time which I lost track while walking in it. One tiny, little complain is about the amount of the exercise haha. I love to walk, but the weather is just too cold to walk for so long. I think it might help if some part of the walk could be replaced by transportation? Also, on the tube or bus, there is so much to talk about the management of time related to the history of the transportation. The invention of the timetable for trains is an important landmark for the development of the capitalism. They adopted to the Greenwich time since 1847, which is several years before the most of clocks in England adjust to the standard time. Besides, we walk in a quite uniform speed, taking the transportation could suddenly speed it up, which could also be an interesting bodily experience of time. I think the surprise of the fast pace in the Canary Wharf would be intensified if we suddenly transported from the cozy dock to it in 5/10 minutes(not sure how long it will take). Afterall, it is absolutely an amazing project!</p>
